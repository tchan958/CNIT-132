        Hello! Welcome to my homepage for Intermediate HTML and CSS. My name is Takyu Chan. I hope we will have a blast
        this semester!

        I chose this image because I want to pursue a degree in coding. I was always more of a hands on learner.
        Originally, I tried to be a biology major but I wasn't able to memorize all the given terms which lead to me
        switching majors to business admin. While I good at math, it got really boring which lead to me switching to
        math but even I had a lot of issues memorizing all the formulas and proofs. So here I am, changing my major for
        the last time doing coding. Coding sparked so much interest from me that I actually tried to do a coding
        bootcamp and somehow completed it but unfortunately forgot a lot of it since it was a year ago!
